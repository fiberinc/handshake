# Reporting Security Issues

The Fiber team and community take security bugs in Fiber seriously. We
appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make
every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory "Report a
Vulnerability" tab.

The Fiber team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your
report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you
informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for
additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the npm contact form by
selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".

## The Handshake Security Notification Process

For context on Fiber's security notification process, please see the
Notifications section of the Security WG's Membership and Notifications
Governance document.
