### from-next-auth

Credit for about 60 of our providers goes to
[next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/), its authors and contributors.

The next-auth project keeps a high-quality library of OAuth details about dozens
of third-party APIs. When possible, we use that library instead of duplicating
the effort ourselves.

This currently uses auth-next v4. The upcoming v5 seems currently a mess but
already features updated connectors. We should switch to that when we can.

See https://next-auth.js.org

### from-grant

We also used the provider list from the Grant library. 🙏 🙏 🙏
