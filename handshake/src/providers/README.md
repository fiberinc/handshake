# from-next-auth

The next-auth project keeps a high-quality library of OAuth details about dozens
of third-party APIs. When possible, we use that library instead of duplicating
the effort ourselves.

This currently uses auth-next v4. The upcoming v5 seems currently a mess but
already features updated connectors. We should switch to that when we can.
